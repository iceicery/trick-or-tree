## Inspiration
We are a couple with two kids. While we enjoy outdoors and love trees, we don't know the first thing about any trees. 
We think this would be a great opportunity for us to learn more about the trees around us together as a family, 
and we hope our project can help others do the same. 

## What it does
Trick-or-Treat is a hybrid of scavenger hunt, tree identification, and education. 
In addition to having easy accesses to information about the champion trees in Alabama, 
the users can also find targets from a user-defined list of trees, 
and answer some guided questions to learn about the specifics of the target tree. 
One the users correctly recognize the unique features of the target, they will be awarded with a badge!
It's an app that you can use outdoors, to make your afternoon stroll more interesting and educational;
and it's an app that you can use at home to learn about the AL champion trees and the trees with which you've earned badges. 

## How we built it
We scrapped the AL champion tree data from the Alabama Forestry Commission, and supplement the table with images and facts the from the leafsnap database and wikipedia. 
The data cleaning and aggregation were done using python with packages such as pandas and geopandas. The webapp was developed using a combination of React.js, node.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Leaflet.js.

## Challenges we ran into
Doing the hackathon through the week was certainly, 
with two kids and other work responsibilities, 
there is very limited time to develop UI/UX for an webapp. 
Data cleaning and aggregation were also challenging due to the inhomogeneity of different data sources.
Being almost a completely novice in trees and biology was also challenging, but overall it was a very fun and rewarding experience.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our idea and the results. 
The app achieved our goal of being user-friendly, our 7-year-old son certainly seemed to understand the gist of it.
Also, we were able to do a field test of the app at the Huntsville Botanical Garden 
and we are proud of the results -- it proved to be a quite interesting and informative trip.

## What we learned
Trees, where to find trees, and how to identify trees. 

## What's next for Trick-or-tree
One things that's currently missing in our webapp is the in-depth knowledge on the genetic information of different trees. 
We have already collected gene and genome datasets for different species in our AL champion tree list. 
We plan to learn more about the genome of different tree species and 
Also, we think the webapp can be of use to educators in many different topics. 
We plan to expand the back-end functionality to make creating a custom list a breeze for anyone,
after which we will reach out to local teachers, botanical garden and museum staff, and hopefully our product would bring joy and knowledge to many people.
